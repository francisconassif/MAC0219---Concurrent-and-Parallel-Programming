This work, related to the MAC0219 course, implemented C++ and Python versions based on the same pseudocode. Each implementation was executed 100 times using the run_tests.sh script generated by ChatGPT. The execution times for each run were recorded in milliseconds in the following files:

- mini1_cpp_times.txt
- mini1_py_times.txt

These files were used as input for calculamedia.cpp, a program that calculated the mean and standard deviation of the times, which were recorded in the files miniEP.txt and estatisticas.txt.

The source code can be found in leapfrog.cpp and leapfrog.py.
